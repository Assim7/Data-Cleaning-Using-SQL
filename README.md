# Overview

This repository contains a portfolio project where I cleaned a dataset of layoffs using SQL. 
The dataset, `layoffs.csv`, contains information about layoffs across various companies and industries.
The goal of this project was to clean the data to make it suitable for analysis, ensuring consistency, removing duplicates, and handling missing values.

## Data Cleaning Steps
The data cleaning process involved the following steps:

1- Loading the Data: Importing the layoffs.csv file into a SQL database.

2- Removing Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

3- Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or removing the records if necessary.

4- Standardizing Formats: Ensuring consistency in data formats, such as date formats and string casing.

5- Data Validation: Verifying the accuracy and completeness of the data.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to clean and preprocess data using SQL, ensuring the data is ready for further analysis. 
The cleaned dataset can be used for various analytical purposes, such as identifying layoff trends, analyzing industry impacts, and more.
